## üöÄ Live Demo
[Deploy on Vercel/Netlify - Ready for hosting]

## üìã Requirements Analysis

### ‚úÖ Must Have Requirements (All Implemented)

#### 1. Project Setup
- **‚úÖ React with Next.js 15 and TypeScript** - Modern React with App Router
- **‚úÖ Sensible file structure** - Clear component boundaries with hooks, components, and pages organized logically
- **‚úÖ Component boundaries** - Separated concerns: data fetching hooks, UI components, page components

#### 2. Data List + Detail View
- **‚úÖ List view with pagination** - 20 Pokemon per page with navigation controls
- **‚úÖ Detail view routing** - `/pokemon/[id]` route with modal overlay support
- **‚úÖ Click to view details** - Both modal popup and dedicated detail pages

#### 3. Search, Filter, Sort
- **‚úÖ Debounced search (400ms)** - Prevents excessive API calls while typing
- **‚úÖ URL-bound state** - All search/filter/sort state synced with URL parameters
- **‚úÖ Multiple filters** - Pokemon type filtering with visual chips
- **‚úÖ Sort options** - By Pokedex number, name, or favorites
- **‚úÖ Shareable URLs** - Direct links recreate exact state

#### 4. Favorites
- **‚úÖ Toggle favorites** - From both list and detail views
- **‚úÖ localStorage persistence** - Favorites survive browser sessions
- **‚úÖ Favorites filter** - Sort by favorites functionality
- **‚úÖ Real-time updates** - Custom event system for instant UI updates

#### 5. Data Fetching and State
- **‚úÖ Loading states** - Skeleton placeholders and loading indicators
- **‚úÖ Error handling** - Retry buttons and graceful error messages
- **‚úÖ Request cancellation** - AbortController prevents race conditions
- **‚úÖ Optimistic UI** - Instant feedback for favorite toggles

### ‚úÖ Nice-to-Have Features (3 Implemented)

#### 1. **Optimistic UI for Favorite Toggles** ‚úÖ
- **Why chosen**: Provides immediate feedback and feels responsive
- **Implementation**: Custom `useFavorites` hook with event dispatching
- **Trade-off**: Slightly more complex state management for better UX

#### 2. **Virtualized List** ‚úÖ 
- **Why chosen**: Essential for performance with 1000+ Pokemon
- **Implementation**: `react-window` for efficient rendering
- **Trade-off**: Added dependency but significant performance gain

#### 3. **Code Splitting for Detail Route** ‚úÖ
- **Why chosen**: Reduces initial bundle size and improves load times
- **Implementation**: Next.js App Router automatic code splitting
- **Trade-off**: Minimal - Next.js handles this automatically

#### Not Implemented:
- **Client caching**: Chose simplicity over complexity for MVP
- **Theme toggle**: Focused on core functionality first
- **Form with validation**: Beyond scope of Pokemon exploration
- **E2E tests**: Manual testing sufficient for MVP
- **Advanced accessibility**: Basic accessibility implemented

### ‚úÖ Tricky Bits (All Implemented)

#### 1. **URL as Source of Truth** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: `useSearchParams` and `useRouter` for state sync
- **Why important**: Enables bookmarking and sharing specific searches
- **Trade-off**: More complex state management but better UX

#### 2. **Abort on Change** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: `AbortController` in all fetch operations
- **Why critical**: Prevents race conditions and stale data
- **Trade-off**: Slightly more code for robust data handling

#### 3. **Empty States** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: Helpful "no results" messages with suggestions
- **Why important**: Guides users when filters return no results
- **Trade-off**: Extra UI states to handle but much better UX

#### 4. **Back/Forward Navigation** ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: `useScrollRestoration` and `useFocusManagement` hooks
- **Why important**: Maintains user context across navigation
- **Trade-off**: Additional complexity for seamless navigation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- **URL-first approach**: Search/filter/sort state lives in URL
- **Custom hooks**: `usePokemonData`, `usePokemonFilters`, `usePokemonSearch`
- **Event-driven favorites**: Custom events for real-time updates
- **No heavy state manager**: React's built-in state + URL sync sufficient

### Data Fetching
- **AbortController**: All requests cancellable to prevent race conditions
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling with retry mechanisms
- **Loading states**: Skeleton UI and loading indicators
- **No external data library**: Custom hooks provide sufficient caching

### Performance Optimizations
- **Virtual scrolling**: `react-window` for large lists
- **Image optimization**: Next.js Image component with WebP/AVIF
- **Debounced search**: 400ms delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Code splitting**: Automatic with Next.js App Router
