```bash
npm run dev
```

## Notes for Production
- All external API calls are cached appropriately
- No sensitive data or API keys required
- Can be deployed to any static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- Full offline capability for cached Pokemon

## Architecture Decisions
- **URL-first state management** - Search/filter/sort state lives in URL
- **Custom hooks** - No external state manager needed
- **Event-driven favorites** - Real-time updates with custom events
- **AbortController** - All requests cancellable to prevent race conditions
- **Virtual scrolling** - Essential for performance with 1000+ Pokemon
- **Optimistic UI** - Instant feedback for better user experience

## Trade-offs Made
- **No external data library** - Custom hooks provide sufficient functionality
- **No theme switching** - Focused on core Pokemon exploration
- **No E2E tests** - Manual testing and TypeScript provide confidence
- **No advanced caching** - localStorage + URL state sufficient for MVP
